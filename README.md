UFO Sightings

Do you believe in aliens and UFOs?
There have been countless reports of UFO sightings throughout the world, and we have that data at our disposal.

I write code that imports the sightings information and puts it into a nice readable table on the webpage.
After displaying the sightings on the webpage, the user can search or filter the table for specific dates they would like to search on.

This project required the use of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and whole lot of time and effort!
